This example code simulates reflectance and polarized reflectance at TOA and BOA level as a function of wavelength 300-900 nm by steps of 5 nm for a typical atmosphere with clouds, ocean containing phytoplankton, and a typical geometry. 

To run the code, 

1. download 'par_5nm.zip' and SMARTG_examp.py

2. Unzip 'par_5nm.zip'. In the code, change the path to your_directory/par_5nm/

kpar=KDIS('par_5nm','/media/jit079/nvme0n1/PAR/Kdistribution/par_5nm/')

3. Run the code

$ python SMARTG_example.py
