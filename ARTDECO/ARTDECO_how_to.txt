1. Download the zip files (artdeco.zip and data_artdeco.zip) to your working directory and unzip 

$ unzip artdeco.zip
$ unzip data_artdeco.zip

2. Go to the directory 'artdeco/fortran/', type:

$ cd artdeco/fortran/

Create some directories

$ mkdir f2py
$ mkdir mod
$ mkdir obj
$ mkdir out

3. You can now compile the code from Artdeco/fortran/src

$ cd src
$ make

To do this, you need a Fortran 90/95 compiler and f2py (Fortran-Python interface tools provided with the numpy library). You need Python 3. 

4. Go back to the root directory, and run the example code

$ cd ../../../

Change the paths at the top of the file, for example:

# These directories must be changed according to your installation

dir_data = "your_working_directory/data_artdeco/"

dir_artdeco = "your_working_directory/artdeco/fortran/"

dir_pyartdeco = "your_working_directory/pyartdeco/"


"your_working_directory" is the directory where you save the artedco and data_artdeco zip files.


$ python example_use.py


5. Once the code is successively run, the plots of simulated TOA and BOA flux, TOA upwelling radiance, and TOA reflectance are saved in your working directory.
